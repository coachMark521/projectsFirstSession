# projectsFirstSession
projects for the first session of the class
BIO Page:  This page I was able to edit using CSS.  I was also able to show how to change the photos, just by moving the cursor over the photo.
It was a work to show how to section off a page, pick background colors, and images, and link to other pages.
Tribute:  This page I was able to show more work on color, centering text, working with classes and IDs.  
Portfolio:  This page allowed me to start working with flex boxes in CSS.  How to order a page and start using Divs to get things to line up.  Using IDs and 
anchor tags to quickly move down the page to other sections.
Landing page:  Going into bootstrap and starting to use classes from there to make the page look more polished.  Using nav bars, containers, and cards
to make it easier and quicker to design the page.
