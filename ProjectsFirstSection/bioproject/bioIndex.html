                    <h2>Hitting a Softball</h2>

                    Hitting a softball is not easy to accomplish, in fact it is one of the hardest things to do.  A good softball
                    pitcher will try their best to locate the ball on the edge of the plate where it is harder to hit.  They will
                    change speeds of the ball to throw the hitter off and they will place spin on the ball.  When done correctly a 
                    pitcher will throw a pitch on the edge of the plate, at different speeds, and the ball will start moving up, down,
                    right or left depending on the spin.  This all makes hitting the ball extremely hard, so what can a player do when
                    coming up to the plate for the best chance at making a solid connection to the ball?

                        First, the batter needs to be prepared.  That means practice.  Working with coaches, working on drills, and experiencing
                        live pitching before they get up to the plate for the first time in a real game.  That also means that just before they
                        bat they are in the batters box timing the pitcher, looking for where the release is, how good is the spin and if
                        possible how many pitches she has and when does she like to throw them.  By being prepared and confident when they get
                        up to the plate they will have a better chance at making a connection.
                    </p>
                    <p class="story">
                        In practice they should be learning how to swing the bat.  This is the second key to hitting.  The path of the bat that
                        keeps the barrel of the bat in the strike zone the from the back of the plate through the front of the plate gives
                        the batter the best chance of hitting the ball.  Learning how to do this is key to increasing not only the likelyhood
                        of hitting the ball but the power with which it is hit.  This is important if the desire is to get on base and
                        have a chance to score.  Having a coach that can help you with the little adjustments and get your swing correct will
                        be instramental in improving the players average.

                    <p class="story">
                        Finally, for this article at least, have the right attitude.  Attitude is everything, if you do not believe you can hit
                        it will be harder to accomplish the task.  You need to go up to the plate knowing you have done everything to be
                        successful and because of that you will be successful.  Success at hitting is getting one or two hits in a game, not
                        hitting the ball everytime you are at the plate.  Success is making the pitcher work for a strike, not looking at good
                        pitches go by, and being agressive at the plate.  Go up to the plate smiling because you know in this game you are
                        going to get on and help the team win.  It might not be this time but it will happen.  Learn how to swing the bat,
                        be prepared by practicing, and have the confidense that you can do it!
