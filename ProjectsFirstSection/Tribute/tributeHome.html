            <h2>About Pugs History</h2>
            <p id="websiteInfo">Information on the history from the website Dogtime.com</p>
            <p>
                Pugs originated in China, dating back to the Han dynasty (B.C. 206 to A.D. 200). Some historians
                believe they are related to the Tibetan Mastiff. They were prized by the Emperors of China and
                lived in luxurious accommodations, sometimes even being guarded by soldiers. Pugs are one of three
                short-nosed dogs known to have been bred by the Chinese: the Lion dog, the Pekingese, and the Lo-sze,
                which was the ancient Pug. Some think that the famous Foo Dogs of China are representations of the
                ancient Pug. Evidence of Pug-like dogs has been found in ancient Tibet and Japan. In the latter 1500s
                and early 1600s, China began trading with European countries. Reportedly, the first Pugs brought to
                Europe came with the Dutch traders, who named the breed Mopshond, a name still used today.

                Pugs quickly became favorites of royal households throughout Europe and even played a role in the history
                of many of these families. In Holland, the Pug became the official dog of the House of Orange after a Pug
                reportedly saved the life of William, Prince of Orange, by warning him that the Spaniards were approaching
                in 1572. When William of Orange (later called William III) went to England in 1688 with his wife, Mary II,
                to take the throne from James II, they brought their Pugs with them. It is known that black pugs existed
                in the 1700s because the famous artist William Hogarth was a Pug enthusiast. He portrayed a black Pug and
                many others in his famous paintings. In 1785, Goya also portrayed Pugs in his paintings. As the Pugs
                popularity spread throughout Europe, it was often known by different names in different countries. In France,
                it was called Carlin; in Spain, Dogullo; in Germany, Mops; and in Italy, Caganlino.

                Marie Antoinette had a Pug named Mops before she married Louis XVI at 15. Another famous Frenchwoman,
                Josephine Bonaparte, had a Pug named Fortune. Before she married Napoleon Bonaparte, she was confined at Les
                Carmes prison. Since her beloved Pug was the only visitor she was allowed, she would conceal messages in his
                collar to take to her family. In the early 1800s, Pugs were standardized as a breed with two lines becoming
                dominant in England. One line was called the Morrison line and, reportedly, was founded upon the royal dogs of
                Queen Charlotte, wife of George III. The other line was developed by Lord and Lady Willoughby dEresby and was
                founded on dogs imported from Russia or Hungary. Pugs were first exhibited in England in 1861. The studbook
                began in 1871 with 66 Pugs in the first volume. Meanwhile, in China, Pugs continued to be bred by the royal
                families. When the British overran the Chinese Imperial Palace in 1860, they discovered several Pugs and brought
                some of the little dogs back to England with them. Two Pugs named Lamb and Moss were brought to England.
                These two pure Chinese lines were bred and produced by Click. He was an outstanding dog and was bred many
                times to dogs of the Willoughby and Morrison lines. Click is credited with making Pugs a better breed overall
                and shaping the modern Pug as we know it today.

                Pugs became very popular during the Victorian era and were featured in many paintings, postcards, and figurines
                of the period. Often, they were depicted wearing wide, decorative collars or large bows around their short,
                thick necks. Queen Victoria had many Pugs and also bred them. The queen preferred apricot-fawn Pugs, whereas another
                Pug fancier, Lady Brassey, made black Pugs fashionable after she brought some back from China in 1886. Pugs were
                introduced to the United States after the Civil War, and the American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1885.
                At first, Pugs were very popular, but by the turn of the century, interest in the breed waned. A few dedicated
                breeders kept breeding, and after some years, the breed regained popularity. Founded in 1931, the AKC also recognized
                the Pug Dog Club of America that year.

            <h2>Meet Goose</h2>
            <p>Goose is a character, always needing the love of one of us.  He is always near us either in the same space or in
            our laps.  He sits like a little old man and I cannot help but love they way he looks at us.  He is willing to play 
            or just provide some companionship.</p>

        <section id="winnieTrib">
            <h2>Meet Winnie</h2>
            <p>Winnie can be just as needy as Goose but she can also be on her own.  She has rare coloring in her coat and her 
                eyes are different colors.  She is Goose's sister and they both get along well.  When she bonds she wants to be
                close as most pugs do. She is a very happy pug and loves the sun, laying in it when it comes in through the windows.
